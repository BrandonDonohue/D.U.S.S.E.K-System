# D.U.S.S.E.K-System
Senior Design Project 1: **D.U.S.S.E.K System (Duel Use Simon Says and Electronic Keyboard)**

The project was named after a famous pianist named **Jan Ladislav Dussek** who lived from 1760 to 1816.

This was the first part of our senior design project. It was a simple electronic keyboard that also had a Simon Says game built into it with a LCD screen that displayed which mode the user was currently in (either "Free play" or "Simon Says game") and the notes being played. 

While in Simon Says game mode, the screen would display the correct notes to be played, along with an LED that would light above the correct key. The user would then need to play the correct sequence of keys to progress through the game. Once the user failed to play the correct sequence of notes, the game would end and the screen would show their score, being how many sequences they successfully played.
